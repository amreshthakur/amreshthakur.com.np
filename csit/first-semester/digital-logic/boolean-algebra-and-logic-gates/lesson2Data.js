        title: 'Basic and Axiomatic Definitions of Boolean Algebra',
        content: `<h1>Basic and Axiomatic Definitions of Boolean Algebra</h1><p>Boolean algebra is a mathematical structure used to perform operations on logical values (true/false or 1/0). It is defined by a set of axioms, operations (AND, OR, NOT), and elements (usually 0 and 1). Boolean algebra is the foundation of digital circuit design and logic analysis.</p>`

        title: 'Basic Theorems and Properties of Boolean Algebra',
        content: `<h1>Basic Theorems and Properties of Boolean Algebra</h1><p>Boolean algebra includes several important theorems and properties such as Identity, Null, Idempotent, Complement, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Absorption, and DeMorgan’s Theorems. These theorems simplify logic expressions and help design efficient circuits.</p>`

        title: 'Boolean Functions',
        content: `<h1>Boolean Functions</h1><p>Boolean functions are expressions formed using Boolean variables, constants (0 and 1), and logic operations. A Boolean function can be represented using a truth table, logic diagram, or algebraic expression. They are used to model digital circuits.</p>`

        title: 'Logic Operations',
        content: `<h1>Logic Operations</h1><p>Logic operations are fundamental operations performed on Boolean variables. These include AND (.), OR (+), and NOT (‾). Additional operations include NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR, which are combinations of basic operations used in digital systems.</p>`

    'logic-gates': {
        title: 'Logic Gates',
        content: `<h1>Logic Gates</h1><p>Logic gates are hardware devices that perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single output. Common logic gates include AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. They form the building blocks of digital circuits.</p>`

        title: 'Integrated Circuits',
        content: `<h1>Integrated Circuits (ICs)</h1><p>Integrated Circuits are electronic circuits formed on a small chip that integrates multiple logic gates or components. ICs are used in almost all digital devices due to their compact size, low cost, and high reliability. They come in SSI, MSI, LSI, and VLSI types depending on gate count.</p>`
