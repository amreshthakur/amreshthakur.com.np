        title: 'Digital Systems',
        content: `<h1>Digital Systems</h1><p>Digital systems are electronic systems that process and store data in binary format (0s and 1s). They include components like logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and memory units. These systems are used in computers, calculators, and digital devices to perform computations and control operations.</p>`

        title: 'Number Base Conversion',
        content: `<h1>Number Base Conversion</h1><p>Base conversion refers to changing numbers from one numeral system to another (e.g., from decimal to binary, octal, or hexadecimal). Conversion methods include division-remainder for integer parts and multiplication for fractional parts.</p>`

    'octal-hexadecimal': {
        title: 'Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers',
        content: `<h1>Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers</h1><p>Octal is a base-8 system (digits 0-7) and hexadecimal is a base-16 system (digits 0-9 and A-F). These systems simplify binary representations and are commonly used in digital electronics and programming.</p>`

    'complements': {
        title: 'Complements',
        content: `<h1>Complements</h1><p>Complements are used in binary arithmetic to simplify subtraction. The two types are 1’s complement (invert all bits) and 2’s complement (1’s complement + 1). 2’s complement is widely used for representing negative binary numbers.</p>`
    },
    'signed-binary': {
        title: 'Signed Binary Numbers',
        content: `<h1>Signed Binary Numbers</h1><p>Signed binary numbers represent both positive and negative integers. Common methods include sign-magnitude, 1’s complement, and 2’s complement. The leftmost bit (MSB) is the sign bit: 0 for positive, 1 for negative.</p>`

    'decimal-codes': {
        title: 'Decimal Codes',
        content: `<h1>Decimal Codes</h1><p>Decimal codes are binary representations of decimal digits. Examples include Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), Excess-3, and Gray Code. These codes are useful in applications like digital displays and error detection.</p>`
