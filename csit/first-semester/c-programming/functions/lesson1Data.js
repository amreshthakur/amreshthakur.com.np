    'functions-library': {
        title: 'Library Functions',
        content: `<h1>Library Functions</h1><p>Library functions are predefined functions provided by C libraries, such as <code>printf()</code>, <code>scanf()</code>, <code>strlen()</code>, and many others. They help simplify programming tasks and require inclusion of appropriate header files.</p>`
    },
    'functions-user-defined': {
        title: 'User-Defined Functions',
        content: `<h1>User-Defined Functions</h1><p>These are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. They promote code reuse, modularity, and better organization in programs.</p>`
    },
    'functions-prototype-call-definition': {
        title: 'Function Prototype, Call, and Definition',
        content: `<h1>Function Prototype, Call, and Definition</h1><p>A function prototype declares the function signature. The call invokes the function, and the definition provides its actual code. All three are essential for function execution in C.</p>`
    },
    'functions-nested-recursion': {
        title: 'Nested Functions and Recursion',
        content: `<h1>Nested Functions and Recursion</h1><p>Nested functions are functions called within other functions. Recursion occurs when a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve problems like factorial or Fibonacci sequence.</p>`
    },
    'functions-arguments-return': {
        title: 'Function Arguments and Return Types',
        content: `<h1>Function Arguments and Return Types</h1><p>Functions may receive inputs (arguments) and return values. The return type defines the data type of the result. Functions can also return <code>void</code> if no value is returned.</p>`
    },
    'functions-pass-arrays': {
        title: 'Passing Arrays to Functions',
        content: `<h1>Passing Arrays to Functions</h1><p>Arrays can be passed to functions as arguments. Since arrays are passed by reference, the changes made inside the function affect the original array.</p>`
    },
    'functions-pass-strings': {
        title: 'Passing Strings to Functions',
        content: `<h1>Passing Strings to Functions</h1><p>Strings, as character arrays, are passed to functions similarly to arrays. Modifications within the function can reflect on the original string unless <code>const</code> is used.</p>`
    },
    'functions-call-by': {
        title: 'Call by Value and Call by Address',
        content: `<h1>Call by Value and Call by Address</h1><p>Call by value passes a copy of the variable, keeping the original unchanged. Call by address passes the memory address, allowing functions to modify the original variable.</p>`
    },
    'functions-scope-visibility': {
        title: 'Scope, Visibility, and Lifetime of Variables',
        content: `<h1>Scope, Visibility, and Lifetime of Variables</h1><p>Scope determines where a variable can be accessed. Visibility controls its access across different parts of the program. Lifetime is how long a variable exists in memory.</p>`
    },
    'functions-local-global': {
        title: 'Local and Global Variables',
        content: `<h1>Local and Global Variables</h1><p>Local variables are declared inside functions and accessible only within them. Global variables are declared outside functions and accessible throughout the program.</p>`
    }
