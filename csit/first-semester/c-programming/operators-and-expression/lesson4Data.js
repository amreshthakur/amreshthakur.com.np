    'arithmetic-operators': {
        title: 'Arithmetic Operators',
        content: `<h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1><p>Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). These are used to compute numeric values in expressions.</p>`
    },
    'relational-operators': {
        title: 'Relational Operators',
        content: `<h1>Relational Operators</h1><p>Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false). Common relational operators are: == (equal to), != (not equal to), &gt; (greater than), &lt; (less than), &gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less than or equal to).</p>`
    },
    'logical-operators': {
        title: 'Logical (Boolean) Operators',
        content: `<h1>Logical Operators</h1><p>Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions: && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT). These are essential in control flow and conditional statements.</p>`
    },
    'assignment-operators': {
        title: 'Assignment Operators',
        content: `<h1>Assignment Operators</h1><p>Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The basic operator is =, and compound operators include +=, -=, *=, /=, and %= which perform an operation and assign the result.</p>`
    },
    'inc-dec-operators': {
        title: 'Increment and Decrement Operators',
        content: `<h1>Increment and Decrement Operators</h1><p>These operators increase or decrease a variable’s value by one. Increment (++) and decrement (--) can be used in prefix (++a) or postfix (a++) forms, with slightly different behavior in expressions.</p>`
    },
    'ternary-operator': {
        title: 'Ternary (Conditional) Operator',
        content: `<h1>Ternary Operator</h1><p>The ternary operator (?:) is a shorthand for if-else statements. It has the form: <code>condition ? expression1 : expression2</code>. If the condition is true, expression1 is evaluated; otherwise, expression2 is.</p>`
    },
    'bitwise-operators': {
        title: 'Bitwise Operators',
        content: `<h1>Bitwise Operators</h1><p>Bitwise operators operate on bits and include: & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), &lt;&lt; (left shift), &gt;&gt; (right shift). These are mainly used for low-level programming, such as manipulating binary data.</p>`
    },
    'special-operators': {
        title: 'Special Operators: sizeof, Comma (,)',
        content: `<h1>Special Operators</h1><p>Special operators include: <strong>sizeof</strong> which returns the size (in bytes) of a variable or data type, and <strong>comma operator (,)</strong> which allows multiple expressions in a single statement. Only the last expression is returned.</p>`
    },
    'expression-evaluation': {
        title: 'Evaluation of Expressions',
        content: `<h1>Evaluation of Expressions</h1><p>Expression evaluation follows operator precedence and associativity rules. Expressions are evaluated left-to-right or right-to-left depending on these rules. Parentheses can alter the default order.</p>`
    },
    'precedence-associativity': {
        title: 'Operator Precedence and Associativity',
        content: `<h1>Operator Precedence and Associativity</h1><p>Operator precedence determines which operator is evaluated first in an expression. Associativity determines the order when operators of the same precedence appear. For example, * and / have higher precedence than + and -, and most operators are left-associative.</p>`
